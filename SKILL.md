# Mockumentary Framework Builder

Transform linear narrative into mockumentary format using documentary-style observation, talking head interviews, camera awareness, and the gap between self-perception and reality.

## What This Skill Does

Transforms content by:
- Adding "talking head" interview segments where characters explain themselves
- Inserting camera-aware moments (the "Jim look")
- Creating gap between what characters say and what we see them do
- Structuring content with documentary realism (no laugh track, no setup/punchline)
- Adding observational layer that exposes character delusions

## When to Use

**Automatic Triggers:**
- "Add documentary style"
- "Mockumentary format"
- "Office-style structure"
- "Add talking heads"
- "Camera-aware moments"

**Situation Triggers:**
- Need to expose gap between self-image and reality
- Character's delusions need highlighting
- Linear narrative feels flat or conventional
- Want to add meta-awareness layer
- Content benefits from observational perspective

## Core Mockumentary Elements

### Element 1: Talking Head Interviews

Characters speak directly to camera, explaining their perspective.

**Structure:**
```
[TALKING HEAD - CHARACTER NAME]

CHARACTER: "I think people misunderstand me sometimes. I'm actually very approachable."

[Cut to observed reality contradicting this claim]
```

### Element 2: The Jim Look (Camera Glance)

Character looks directly at camera after witnessing absurdity.

**Structure:**
```
MANAGER: "...and that's why I'm the funniest person in this office."

[Employee glances at camera with "Are you hearing this?" expression]
```

### Element 3: Interview-Reality Gap

Cut between what character says and what actually happened.

**Structure:**
```
[TALKING HEAD - MANAGER]
MANAGER: "I'm a friend first, boss second."

[CUT TO: Earlier that day]
MANAGER: [Yelling] "I don't pay you to think!"

[Back to talking head]
MANAGER: "That's what makes me so approachable."
```

### Element 4: Documentary Observation Markers

Stage directions indicating crew presence:
- `[Camera catches Employee rolling eyes]`
- `[Documentary crew follows Manager down hallway]`
- `[Camera holds on Employee's reaction]`
- `[Zoom in on deadpan expression]`

### Element 5: Documentary Realism

**Remove:**
- Laugh tracks
- Musical cues
- Theatrical setup/punchline structure
- Unrealistic rapid-fire dialogue

**Add:**
- Realistic overlapping speech
- Mundane details
- Natural pauses
- Incomplete sentences

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Input Content

Identify:
- Key character claims or self-perceptions
- Moments where self-image contradicts reality
- Opportunities for camera-aware moments
- Points where documentary observation heightens comedy

### Step 2: Add Talking Head Structure

1. Find character's self-perception
2. Create talking head where they explain this perception
3. Show reality contradicting it
4. Optional: Return to talking head for oblivious follow-up

### Step 3: Insert Camera-Aware Moments

Add Jim-looks when:
- Someone says something ridiculous
- Character reveals obliviousness
- During uncomfortable situations
- When rational character witnesses absurdity

### Step 4: Add Documentary Markers

Insert stage directions showing crew presence:
- `[Camera lingers on reaction]`
- `[Documentary crew follows]`
- `[Zoom slowly on face]`

### Step 5: Remove Conventional Elements

Strip out laugh track markers, musical cues, theatrical transitions.

### Step 6: Add Documentary Realism

Include mundane details, realistic overlaps, natural pauses.

## Output Format

```
[OPEN: Office setting. Documentary crew observing]

[TALKING HEAD - CHARACTER]
CHARACTER: "[Self-perception claim]"

[CUT TO: OFFICE]
[Reality contradicting claim]

[Character glances at camera with expression]

[CUT TO: TALKING HEAD - CHARACTER]
CHARACTER: "[Oblivious follow-up]"
```

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] At least 2 talking head interviews per scene
- [ ] Clear interview-reality gap showing character delusion
- [ ] Minimum 1 camera-aware moment (Jim look)
- [ ] Documentary observational markers present
- [ ] Removed conventional sitcom elements
- [ ] Added documentary realism (mundane details, natural pauses)
- [ ] Gap between self-perception and reality is clear and comedic

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Too Many Talking Heads** - Strategic placement, not every line
**Explaining Everything** - Character misinterprets, doesn't recap
**Overusing Camera Looks** - Selective use by rational characters
**Forgetting Documentary Realism** - No laugh tracks or musical stings
**Not Showing the Gap** - Talking head must contradict reality

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Documentary format structure applied consistently
- [ ] Talking heads reveal character self-perception
- [ ] Reality scenes contradict self-perception
- [ ] Camera-aware moments create audience complicity
- [ ] Documentary realism replaces sitcom conventions
- [ ] Gap between self-image and reality drives comedy
